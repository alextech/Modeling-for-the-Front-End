Supporting code for the talk "Modeling for the Front End". The talk covers techniques to avoid unmanageable data flow from server to client and back by establishing models and corresponding model stores.  The bootstrap template is meant to both appeal to most relatable use case, as well as provide alternative to slides.  Individual detail boxes are meant to be used throughout the presentation to test different scenarios to provide interactive feedback, as opposed to switching to and from power point. Each scenario is separated in their own branches. Checkout branches starting from 1 to 6 and compare how the presentation points are delivered to the UI.

To run the code, need to install dependencies either through **npm install** or by downloading bootstrap and jquery manually, if node package management is not your preference. Then point any web server to the directory to serve **index.html**.  Unfortunately, serving from file system directly is not supported because of CORS.
